# ðŸ¤® Disgus

A commenting system for your blog or website based on [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) open protocol. It's like Disqus but Nostier...

## Requirements

Must have a Nostr `pubkey` and `relay`.

NIP07 compatible browser plug-in for login and admistration.

## Usage

Add the following code to the head of your page.

```html
<!-- SHOULD provide a canonical URL -->
<title>YOUR SITE TITLE</title>
<link rel="canonical" href="https://your-website.com/blog-post" />
<meta property="nostr:pubkey" content="YOUR_NOSTR_PUB_KEY" />
<meta property="nostr:relay" content="YOUR_NOSTR_RELAY" />
<!-- CAN provide the exact event_id for the channel to avoid ambuigity -->
<meta property="nostr:channel" content="LEAVE_EMPTY_IF_NONE_IT_WILL_FIND_IT" />

<!-- Our css -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/disgus/dist/style.css">
```

Add the following where you would like the comments to load up in the body of your page.

```html
<div id="disgus"></div>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/disgus/dist/index.js" async></script>
```

## How it works

Every page/author gets a Nostr note/event created by a random user when posting the first response.

This event becomes the 'root' note for all the other responses in the thread.

Offers NIP-07 for login or just type a name to post as a **Rando** (non-NIP05 veriefied temp guest like account).

> If you have the same relays set on Damus or whatever other Nostr client you will be able to see replies, etc. The 'author' user will get alerts as they are tagged in the root post as well.
